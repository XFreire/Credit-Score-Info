score information from the endpoint given. The donut should display the correct
value received from the endpoint.

The endpoint: https://5lfoiyb0b3.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/prod/mockcredit/values

## Requirements
The following requirements should be met:

- Use the latest version of Swift.
- The code should be production grade.
- It should compile and run.

## Tips/Advice

- Testing is very important for us and you should take that into
consideration when creating this demo. Even if you don&#39;t write a
single test (e.g. because of time constraints), your app should be
easy to test.
- Error scenarios should be taken into consideration as well and how
easy it is to add them, even if you don&#39;t explicitly show them (e.g.
using a UIAlertController).
- Although UI and UX are important, in this demo, we are more
concerned on how you architect your application and your thought
process. It should take into consideration features that might be
added in the future.
- You can use any 3rd party library you wish. In case you do, be
prepared to justify why you used it. You can use CocoaPods,
Carthage for this.

Clean the file project structure (if you are creating one from scratch) and
remove any unused methods (e.g. AppDelegate).

We understand that your time may be limited so we are not expecting a
perfect solution. Where you would have done something differently
given more time, please explain what you would have done and why.
